DC20Pack - the Software Package for Kodak DC20 and DC25 digital cameras.

It contains dc20term and dc2totga - see dc20pack.htm for details.
If you like it quick and simple you should edit and run the script dc20dump

dc20dump will dump out all pictures from your camera and convert it to
Targa24 image files.

First start make to get dc20term and dc2totga executables.

Check the script dc20dump for the parameters of dc20term and change
it if necessary:
-C2 means the camera is connected to COM2
-B115200 means 115200 Baud

Be sure you have access to the serial devices:
/dev/ttyS0 for COM1
/dev/ttyS1 for COM2
/dev/ttyS2 for COM3
/dev/ttyS3 for COM4

Now switch on your camera and run dc20dump.

How it works:
dc20term stores all pictures as raw data files (dc_NNN.dc2) and generates
the file dc2tga.cmd. Now dc2totga knows what to do: It converts the dc_NNN.dc2
files to dc_NNN.tga files.
