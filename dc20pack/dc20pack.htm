  DC20 Software Pack
</H1>
<P>
There are two programs written by myself
(<A HREF="mailto:Oliver.Hartmann@t-online.de">Oliver.Hartmann@t-online.de</A>):
<BR>
DC20Term transfers the pictures out of the camera and stores they as raw
data files - like the change for a new film. <BR>
DC2toTGA converts those raw data files to standard image files - like the
development of the film.
<P>
So you get the pictures out of your camera as quick as possible and you are
ready for the next shots. Later, to get the best results, you can convert
the raw data files to standard image files as often you like.
<P>
The actual versions of both programs are available for DOS, Win16, Win32
and Linux. <BR>
See:

<H3>
  Kodak DC20 Terminal: DC20Term
</H3>
<P>
For the first time, you can just plug in the camera and dump all the images
out of it - only with one keystroke. No answering millions of questions with
the mouse, and all the tedious work in the twain module and the image software,
to finally end up the files in one directory.
<P>
Features:
<UL>
  <LI>
    very quick and simple to use
  <LI>
    runs on any DOS computer (e.g. an old portable)

    transfers all images from camera to disk in batch mode
  <LI>
    supports all camera functions (e.g. res change, erase, etc.)
  <LI>
    stores images in raw data format (like inside the camera) - so you can save
    a lot of disk space

  DC2-to-TGA-File-Converter: DC2toTGA
</H3>
<P>
After use of DC20Term you want to see your pictures. <BR>
DC2toTGA converts the raw data files to a standard image format (Targa).
<BR>
<P>
See the short <A HREF="#hints2">User's Guide</A>!

Features:
<UL>
  <LI>
    simple to use
  <LI>
    can convert all files in batch mode
  <LI>
    a lot of options to get optimal images
  <LI>
    needs no camera to run
  <LI>
    as DOS, Win16&nbsp;and Win32 application available
  <LI>
    provides 375*496 images
  <LI>
    you can get better results (compared to the KODAK Twain Module V1.0)!

<P>
The program reads the data bytes sending by the camera via polling. Since
the camera provides no handshake signals, this is a real time job and could
go wrong in a multitasking environment. Maybe you must reduce the baud rate
to avoid communication problems.
<P>
<H3>
  Troubleshooting:
</H3>
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>
    Best environment for the DOS version dc20term.exe is plain DOS
  <LI>
    Best interface is a hardware buffered com port (16550 UART with FIFO). Use
    Option -F with the DOS version.
  <LI>
    If there is only a 8250 UART the maximum baud rate depends on your system
    speed. Use option -B to find the optimum.
  <LI>
    If you want to use the DOS program in a multitasking environment (like
    MS-Windows), run it in a high priority DOS-Box (e.g. through PIF). Full screen
    mode works much better than a DOS window.
  <LI>
    Pay attention to correct parameter settings. If you start without any parameter
    it works well in most cases (com port parameter is essential if not equal
    to COM1). See 'Syntax Examples' below.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>
  Syntax Examples:<BR>
</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>
    DC20TERM -B57600 -C2 -F<BR>
    means:<BR>
    - baud rate: 57,600<BR>
    - com port: 2 <BR>
    - looking for a 16550 UART (com port with FIFO)
  <LI>
    Option -F:<BR>
    without this option a FIFO is ignored,<BR>
    with -F the program test the com port for a FIFO - if a FIFO will be found,
    it will be used and there is a note 'xxx baud (using FIFO)' on the first
    line - if no FIFO will be found you get the message 'xxx baud (no FIFO found)'
    on the first line.
  <LI>
    default values are -B9600, -C1, ignore FIFO<BR>
    In most cases it works well, but with 9600 baud the picture download takes
    some minutes.
  <LI>
    I use the program with these parameters:<BR>
    DC20TERM -B115200 -F<BR>
    It works well (also under Win95) and the download of a high resolution picture
    (124,928 byte) takes about 15 seconds.
  <LI>
    Option -V (version 1.43 or higher):<BR>
    DC20TERM -V100<BR>
    - takes 100 pictures in time-lapse video mode<BR>
    - actions: erase, take picture, download, erase, take picture, ... and so
    on<BR>
    - frame rate depends on baud rate
  <LI>
    batch processing:<BR>
    DC20TERM &lt;cmd.txt <BR>
    or<BR>
    DC20TERM -C2 -B115200 -F &lt;cmd.txt<BR>
    - cmd.txt should contain the keystroke commands<BR>
    - D command will not work in batch mode =&gt; use X command (version 1.43
    or higher)
</UL>
<P>
<H2>
  <A NAME="hints2"><!-- --></A>Tips for DC2toTGA users
</H2>
<P>
Versions before 1.40 convert only high resolution .dc2 files.<BR>
<B>Version 1.40 or later now converts high and low res pictures.</B>
<P>
The images created with the Kodak software (or the Chinon software) and the
output of DC2toTGA often differ. The main reason is the higher contrast of
the Kodak images. You can get quite similar results with the parameter -v0.65.
But you lose a lot of details in the shadows. That's why I set the gamma
default to 0.5. Another difference is the color adjustment: Try changing
of red factor (e.g. to 0.7 or 0.75) or blue factor (e.g. 0.9).
<H3>
  Syntax Examples:<BR>
</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>
    DC2toTGA -a<BR>
    will convert all files stored with DC20term (e.g. DC_001.DC2 to DC_008.DC2)
  <LI>
    DC2toTGA my_pic1<BR>
    will convert MY_PIC1.DC2
  <LI>
    DC2toTGA -x25<BR>
    will convert the file DC_025.DC2
  <LI>
    DC2toTGA -x4 -a<BR>
    will convert DC_004.DC2 and all files up to DC_999.DC2 (if exist)
  <LI>
    DC2toTGA -a -v0.7<BR>
    will convert all files (see above) using a gamma value of 0.7 (more contrast)
  <LI>
    DC2toTGA -o0<BR>
    no finishing (sharpen)
</UL>
<P>
In&nbsp;most cases the default values are good enough. If the resulting image
looks bad, start again with different settings for saturation, gamma value
or norm_percentage.
