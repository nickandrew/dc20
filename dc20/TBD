I will NOT be adding any fancy image processing utilities
to this program, it is not competing with gimp or xv. Instead
I would rather concentrate on improving the reliability
and making it as foolproof as possible.

Camera features not yet enabled:

1. When the battery is low, the camera sometimes
   switches itself off, resulting in errors which
   are not always caught elegantly. Although, the
   program does recover.

2. Possibly incorporate the cmttoppm program into
   the dc20bin driver (maybe also pnmscale, and
   even cjpeg) to reduce dependencies, and simplify
   usage.
