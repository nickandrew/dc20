INTRODUCTION:

	Here is a complete user friendly package for 
	those who have the Kodak DC20 camera.

	It consists of two programs, a low-level driver for
	manipulating the camera from the command line and
	a Tcl/Tk front-end which uses the driver.

	I assume you have a standard Linux installation which
	contains, Tcl/Tk, the jpeg libraries and pbm utilities.

	You can use the internal viewer, or choose any standard
	external viewer.

INSTALLATION:
	
	1. The binaries are installed to /usr/bin, so ensure
           you are root before installing.

	2. Enable read write access to the serial port that you
	   attach your camera to, this should be one of /dev/ttyS0,
	   through to /dev/ttyS3. These are probed on startup of 
	   the program.

RUNNING:

	Assuming you have /usr/bin in our path, simply run:

		dc20

THANKS:

	The low-level driver was based on Karl Hakimian's dc20 software,
	and the conversion program, cmttoppm was written by YOSHIDA
	Hideki.
